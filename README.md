## Project Specifications

X company wants to build a **commit activity chart** similar to GitHub, to visually display commit activity.

<img width="988" alt="commit-activity-chart" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129616867/229562019-840c9da6-a56b-4785-b4ed-912d863ec44f.png">

The goal is create a horizontal grid of squares(any size), and color the square depending on the number of commits a specific day has.
For example, if the date `2019-01-01` has `4 commits`, the color would be Blue.

The coloring rules for each square are as follows:

    Grey (#EBEDF0): 0 commits
    Green (#7BC96F): 1-3 commits
    Blue (#6F97C9): 4-6 commits
    Grey (#FF203C): 7 or more commits

Use the following API Endpoint to get the commit activity data:

### Provided functions

In order ro speed up the process, you can use the methods below to grab the specific days we want. There is no need to have the dates be dynamic.

// prefixes single-digit numbers (n) with leading 0 (ie: from 1 to 01)

    const pad = (n) => {
        n = n + "";
        return n.length >= 2 ? n : `0${n}`;
    };

// gets the days for the task<br />
// returns an array of 31 strings like:<br />
// ['2019-01-01', '2019-01-02', ..., '2019-01-31']

    const getDays = () => {
        const numDays = 31;

        return Array.from(Array(numDays)).map((o, i) => {
            return `2019-01-${pad(i + 1)}`;
        });

    };
